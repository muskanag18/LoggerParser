Consider the web-server log in the sample file attached.
A shell scripts written in ruby to output the following :-
-> the number of HTTP 200 errors in it
-> a list of all HTTP response codes in the log and their count You may download the log file and save it locally for testing purposes. For the second part, your script must find all response codes in a generic fashion, you should not hard-code searches for a known list of response codes.

For Output :-
  Execute ruby logreader.rb
